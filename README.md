# RyeLite

RyeLite is an open-source game client for High Spell, forked from HighLite. RyeLite is aimed to be a continuation of HighLite, as HL is no longer updated.

# Installing RyeLite
RyeLite is packaged as an Electron application and provides [Linux](#Linux), [MacOS](#MacOS), and [Windows](#Windows) support.

## Windows
1. Obtain the .exe file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ash-of-the-meadow/RyeliteDesktop/releases/latest)
> [!WARNING]
> In Microsoft Edge, you may recieve a download warning due to RyeLite not being commonly downloaded.
>

>
> You can typically resolve this by clicking '...' and selecting 'Keep'


> [!WARNING]
> RyeLite is currently un-signed due to the inherent cost of obtaining signing certificates for software. This results in install and download warnings.
> If we recieve enough players (or complaints!) we will invest in obtaining certificates.

# Related Repositories
The RyeLite ecosystem is distributed across multiple repositories, each serving a specific purpose in the overall architecture.

### [Desktop Application](https://github.com/ash-of-the-meadow/RyeliteDesktop)
This repository! The desktop application handles:
- Electron-based desktop application mechanics
- Window management and user interface
- Core and plugin loading system
- Auto-updater functionality
- Cross-platform builds (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### [Core](https://github.com/ash-of-the-meadow/rl-core)
The core repository provides two APIs for interacting with the High Spell game code:
- **@highlite/plugin-api** - Deprecated API - TypeScript type definitions for plugin development - Older api to support current plugins. Support is maintained, but new plugins and code should use ryelite-core.
- **@ryelite/core** - TypeScript type definitions for plugin development - Current up-to-date api that newer code and plugins should use, unless a feature is only available in the older api.
- Game state monitoring and interaction APIs
- High Spell game client integration layer
- Plugin development framework and utilities
- Shared interfaces for game data access

### [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/ash-of-the-meadow/rl-plugin-hub)
The Plugin Hub serves as the central registry:
- Verified plugin configurations
- Plugin version management
